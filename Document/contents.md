## Structure

- **Introduction**
    - Reasons for choosing topic
    - Give insight on what is to come
- ***(Pt1)* The science behind dandelion seeds**
    1. Aerodynamics of the seeds (laser + smoke)
    2. Use electron microscope to understand the aerodynamics
- ***(Pt2)* Practical implementation of part 1**
    1. Try to make something fly using similar techniques
        - Experiment with scaling up the whole thing
    2. Make a robot that can fly automagically using this technology
        - Better weather balloons?
- Conclusion & prospect
- Bibliography

| Time               | TODO                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| now ~ April        | - Do literature research <br/> - Make laser  for aerodynamics testing                                                     |
| April ~ May        | - **Dandelions should have seeds by now** <br/> - Analyse seed structure with E-microscope <br/> - Test seed aerodynamics |
| May ~ August       | - Process seed data <br/> - **Finish drafting part 1**                                                                    |
| August ~  December | - Use knowledge from part 1 to make practical examples **â‡’ Part 2**                                                       |
| Leftover time      | - Check and format the document nicely                                                                                    |
